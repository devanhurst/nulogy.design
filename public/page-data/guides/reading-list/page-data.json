Focuses on keeping things simple and minimal even when that leads to more obvious, less graceful code. The section <a href=\"http://jxnblk.com/writing/posts/defining-component-apis-in-react/#keep-props-apis-parallel\">Keep props APIs parallel</a> Succinctly explians the value of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle\">Liskov Substitution</a> in component libraries.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/introducing-the-single-element-pattern-dfbd2c295c5d\">Introducing the Single Element Pattern — Diego Haz</a></h3>\n<p>Five simple rules for building robust and scalable atomic design system components. Add these to Brent Jackson's and you have the core of our component design principles.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://rauchg.com/2015/pure-ui\">Pure UI — Guillermo Rauch</a></h3>\n<p>Makes a strong link between the way that designers have typically approached the design of interfaces and the way that React pure functional UI components address state as a series of pure render \"frames\". This article helped me understand why the pure functional component model is such a good representation of UI.</p>\n<h2>Icons</h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https://ia.net/topics/on-icons\">On Icons — Oliver Reichenstein</a></h3>\n<p>_\"An icon is a symbol equally incomprehensible in all human languages.\"</p>",
